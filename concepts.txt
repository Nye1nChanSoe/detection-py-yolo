Ultralytics - YOLO v11 object detection model

PyTorch - A deep learning library used by YOLO under the hood
          to perform neural network operations

OpenCV - A computer vision library used for handling video input
         displaying frames and drawing bounding boxes

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why yolo11n?

Caveats:
    Evaluated mAP - mean average percision on COCO dataset
    https://cocodataset.org/#explore

yolov8n -> 3.2 million parameters
yolov10 -> 2.3 million parameters
yolo11n -> 2.6 million parameters

yolov8  -> 53.9% precision
yolov10 -> 54.4% precision
yolov11 -> 54.7% precision

## Object detection Accuracy and Confidency scores
Caveats:
    Tested on https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/obb/dota-v2/

YOLOv8  had better performance on larger objects
YOLOv11 had better performance on smaller objects

model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt')

The model is ready to analyze frames and detect objects
based on the classes it knows (80 object classes)


OpenCV cv2 python library opens the default webcam (camera 0)

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)


# Motion capture loop

Camera Feed => Live video stream captured by a camera

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print('Unable read from the webcam')
        break


ret: boolean value to indicate the frame was successfully capture
     True  -> yes
     False -> webcam disconnected, end of video etc..

frame: NumPy array representing the captured image
       Contains the pixel data of the frame

       pixel data => height, width, channels (3-RGB)


results = model.predict(frame, conf=0.7)

passes the captured frame for detection and confidence threshold is set to 70%

results: A list of predictions for the current frame
         Each prediction contains information about detected object

         prediction result => boxes  <list of bounding boxes around detected objects>

        box.xyxy => coordinates of the box (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)
        box.clas => class ID of the detected object (0 for person)
        box.conf => confidence score of the detection

# example output of results
# for a frame containing two detected persons
# it's type is Tensor or NumPy array
[
    {
        "boxes": [
            {"xyxy": [100, 50, 200, 300], "cls": 0, "conf": 0.85},
            {"xyxy": [300, 120, 400, 350], "cls": 0, "conf": 0.80}
        ]
    }

# Embedded face recognition

    Optimized Approach
        - Hash + Face embedding
        - Face embedding: a numerical vector that represents a person's face
        - Compare embeddings to see if a face is similar enough
        - Only save a new image if it's truely unique

    Workflow
        - Extract detected faces from bounding box
        - Compute the face embeddings using `DeepFace`
        - Check embeddings 
            - skip:: is familiar to previously saved faces
            - save:: is new face

[CHALLENGES]
    - My python version is 3.13.1
    - Major packages like `torch` and `tensorflow` are compatible <Python 3.9–3.12>
    - I am currently relying on nightly builds
    - So I have to use it at my own risk
